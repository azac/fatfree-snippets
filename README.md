#### Without Git:
[Download] (https://github.com/uonick/fatfree-snippets/archive/master.zip) the latest source from GitHub  and copy the Fat-Free Snippets folder to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory.

#### With Git:
Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages/User" directory:

    git clone https://github.com/uonick/fatfree-snippets.git

Once you install Package Control, restart ST2 and bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select Fat-Free Snippets when the list appears. The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep Fat-Free Snippets up to date with the latest version.

* OS X:

        ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User
